# New students outside New Zealand

Visa information for new international students outside New Zealand who have not studied (online or in-person) at the University of Auckland before.

## Before you start your student visa application

Before submitting your application to Immigration New Zealand (INZ) ensure you have all required documentation. If you submit an incomplete application, it will delay processing and your application may be declined.  

Allow plenty of time to get your documentation organised and expect for the visa processing to take at least four weeks when submitting a complete application.

#### Immigration New Zealand Update - 23 May 2025

Immigration New Zealand now allows applicants outside New Zealand to apply for a student visa using a **conditional offer of place** if final academic results or other conditions (e.g., IELTS scores) are pending. They will begin assessing these applications and may grant approval in principle. However, an unconditional offer of place is required before a visa can be granted.

More details can be found [here](https://uoa.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/17151).

## Step-by-step: How to apply for your student visa

### Step one - Offer of place

-   Accept your offer of place. 
-   Ideally, you will use a unconditional/firm offer of place for your visa application. However, you may be able to apply for your visa with a **conditional offer of place**. Please refer to the recent INZ update at the top of this page for details.
-   If you have been given offers for multiple programmes, ensure you submit the offer letter for the programme you will be enrolled in.
-   Have a pdf copy of the Offer of Place handy to upload into the visa application portal.

#### **Link:**

-   [Accept or decline an offer place](https://uoa.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/2344/~/accept-or-decline-an-offer-of-place)

### Step two - Pay your fees

-   Pay the estimated annual tuition fees stated on your offer of place/offer of admission including the insurance fees.
-   When you have paid, it may take a few days for your payment to be allocated to your tuition fees account depending on the form of payment used.
-   Once your payment has been allocated you will need to generate a receipt and save a pdf copy to upload with your visa application. 
-   If you are a scholarship recipient, please refer to the Student Visa guide and checklist below for further information.

#### **Links:**

-   [Fee payment methods](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/study/fees-and-money-matters/tuition-fees/paying-your-fees/fee-payment-methods.html)
-   [Generate a receipt](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/study/fees-and-money-matters/tuition-fees/paying-your-fees/statements-invoices-and-receipts.html)

### Step three - Evidence you have enough money to live on

INZ requires you to show evidence that you can support yourself during your studies:

-   For a one year enrolment you will need to show evidence that you have funds available of at least NZ$20,000 or NZ$1,667 per month of study.  
    
-   Refer to the Student Visa guide and checklist below for further information and for acceptable forms of evidence.

#### Link:

-   Evidence of funds to support your study

### Step four - Evidence you have enough money to leave New Zealand

-   In addition to the funds mentioned in the previous step, you’ll also need to show evidence that you have funds available covering the equivalent of a flexible flight ticket to your home country.

### Step five - Evidence of your health and character

-   You may be required to submit a chest x-ray and/or medical certificate with your visa application.
-   You may be required to submit a police certificate (or certificates) and a certified translation if it is not in English to show you are of good character.

-   [Who needs to provide police certificates](https://www.immigration.govt.nz/new-zealand-visas/apply-for-a-visa/tools-and-information/character-and-identity/when-you-need-a-police-certificate)

### Step six - Electronic copies of visa application documents

-   Ensure you have electronic copies of all the above documents available to upload with your student visa application.
-   You will also need to upload a copy of the identity pages on your current passport.

### Step seven - Submit your visa application through the INZ portal

Most students will apply under the Fee paying student visa category.  The University is unable to support Pathway student visa applications at this time.

If you are unsure which category applies to you (e.g. if you are holding a government scholarship) please contact Immigration New Zealand.

You may need to provide documents in addition to the ones mentioned above.
