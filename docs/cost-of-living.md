## Living Costs for International Students

If you’re an international student planning to study in New Zealand, you must show proof of financial support. For tertiary, English language or non-compulsory school study, you need to have NZ$20,000 per year or NZ$1,667 per month if your course is less than a year. However, for compulsory education (years 1-13), you need NZ$17,000 per year or NZ$1,417 per month. This roughly translates to NZ$326 – 384 per week, which serves as a helpful reference for the actual cost of living.

## Earning an Income for International Students

As a student, you may be eligible to work while you study. During study periods, you can generally work up to 20 hours per week, and you can work full-time during vacations. If you’re studying for a research Master’s or PhD, you’re allowed to work full-time while you study.

The minimum wage in New Zealand is NZ$22.7 per hour as of July 2023, but this is for unskilled work. Some students are able to earn more than this. Keep in mind that your earnings will be subject to taxation, although the rate is relatively low (initially 10.5%). Your employer will deduct this tax from your paycheck using the Pay As You Earn system. To give you an idea, if you work 20 hours a week, you can expect to earn a minimum of NZ$393 net during study periods.
